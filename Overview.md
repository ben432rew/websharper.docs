# Overview of WebSharper

(This documentation is for WebSharper 4, which is currently in [open beta](#beta).)

WebSharper is a framework and toolset for developing web/mobile applications and web services 
entirely in C# or F# (or a mix of the two languages) with strongly-typed client-server 
communication and site navigation. 
It provides powerful server-side capabilities *and* a compiler to JavaScript with
a whole set of client-side functional abstractions.

Of course, it is possible to use WebSharper only for its server-side
functionality, or conversely, purely as a C#/F#-to-JavaScript compiler that comes
with powerful libraries. But by taking advantage of both aspects, you can also
benefit from the facilities provided by WebSharper to allow client-server
interaction with minimal boilerplate.

Here is an overview of WebSharper's capabilities.

## Sitelets: server-side functionality

WebSharper Sitelets is an API to parse HTTP requests and serve content in a strongly typed and functional way.
HTTP endpoints are represented by values of a user-defined
EndPoint type, which are parsed from requests based on their shape and some
attributes. With Sitelets, you can:

* Discriminate endpoints based on the HTTP method, URL path, query arguments,
  and request body (JSON or form body).
* Parse and generate JSON based on the shape and attributes of your data type,
  for easy REST APIs.
* Generate links from EndPoint values, practically eliminating the risk of
  internad dead links.
* Generate HTML content from template files or directly in C#/F# with a clean
  syntax.

Learn more about Sitelets: [C#](Sitelets-CSharp.md)/[F#](Sitelets.md).

## JavaScript compiler and client-side abstractions

WebSharper can compile all your C# and/or F# source code to JavaScript.
Full interoperability is supported if you use both languages.
Unlike .NET-to-JavaScript compilers, you can tell WebSharper what parts of your code
should or shouldn't be compiled to JavaScript. This allows you to keep together
related server-side and client-side functionality in a single cohesive code
base. Adding a new feature requiring client-server communication has never been
so safe and swift. 

* Take advantage of C# language constructs on the client side, such as
  [LINQ](Linq-CSharp.md).
* Use powerful F# language features like pattern matching and type providers on the client side.
* Write in a mix of both languages to get the best of both worlds.
* Use a functional and reactive programming style with
  UI.Next [C#](UINext-CSharp.md)/[F#](UINext.md) to let the data flow through your UI.
* Write full web forms in a couple lines of code using
  [WebSharper.Forms](Introduction.md) or
  [WebSharper.Formlets](Formlets.md). (Currently available for F# only)
* Develop libraries with self-contained client and/or server functionality to reuse in multiple projects.
* Many JavaScript libraries has typed interfaces for WebSharper available on NuGet, 
  or write your own using a concise and easily readable [F# DSL](InterfaceGenerator.md).

## Client-server interaction facilities

Including client-side controls inside server-rendered pages and interacting
between the client and the server has never been easier.

* Keep your code base consistent by using the same data types on the server and
  the client.
* Share code between tiers: JavaScript-compiled code is also compiled normally
  to .NET, so you can write a function once and use it directly both on the
  server and on the client.
* Include [client-side generated controls](CS-Controls.md) directly
  inside your page without any indirection.
* Alternatively, you can also include WebSharper client controls inside [ASPX or
  Razor pages (TODO)](CS-AspNet.md).
* Use automated remoting [C#](Remoting-CSharp.md)/[F#](Remoting.md): doing an AJAX request is as simple
  as `await`ing a call to your server-side function.
* Perform JSON serialization on the client using the same typed format as
  Sitelets, allowing you to call your REST APIs without worrying about the
  request format.
* Communicate between the server and the client using
  WebSockets, with automatically serialized
  messages.

## Extra features

* [Source mapping](SourceMapping.md).
* Analyzer for C#, showing WebSharper-specific translation errors as you code.
* Metaprogramming: translate calls to specific methods with your custom logic or 
easily include JavaScript code generated at compile-time.

## WebSharper 4 beta warning

WebSharper 4 is currently released as open beta.
We plan to change NuGet package versioning scheme for the stable release, so all preview
NuGet packages are using the codename Zafir ("sapphire" in Hungarian).

Although most planned changes for the stable release involve fixes, new and returning features,
compiler, server and client runtime performance improvements, breaking changes are possible
to streamline APIs for cleaner use from one or both languages.
